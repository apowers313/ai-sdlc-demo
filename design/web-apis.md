## Recommendation

**For this demo project, I recommend using the Open Trivia Database (OpenTDB) as the primary API**, supplemented by the Bored API for additional functionality.

### Rationale:
1. **Interactive & Engaging**: Trivia games are inherently interactive and perfect for demos
2. **Customizable**: Can adjust difficulty and categories to suit the audience
3. **Rich Content**: 24 categories provide variety for different user interests
4. **Session Management**: Built-in session tokens demonstrate stateful API usage
5. **Educational Value**: Shows parameter handling, response parsing, and error handling
6. **Combination Potential**: Can combine with Bored API to suggest activities when users finish trivia

### Demo Application Concept:
Create a "Brain Break" application that:
- Serves trivia questions from OpenTDB
- Tracks user scores
- When users complete a round, suggests an activity from Bored API
- Could add jokes from JokeAPI as rewards for correct answers

This combination showcases multiple API integrations while creating an entertaining, interactive experience perfect for demonstrating modern web development practices.
